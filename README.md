Using a terminal window under tools, this program displays a background similar to that in the matrix. The terminal is filled with randomly generated characters from 32 - 126 on the ascii table (! to ~) and all set to a dark green color. Runners are randomly generated to start at different columns with different color values, and give the illusion of falling by slowing fading to a darker green. To run, launch the included copy of mars. Under tools open the terminal window. Open the program, assemble, and run.
